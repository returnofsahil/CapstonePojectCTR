### CTR (Click Through Rate)

### About the Project
The goal of the Project is to determine the Best Possible Model for Predicting CTR. CTR or Click Rate
is the ratio of clicks on a specific link to the number of times a page, email, or advertisement is shown. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website, as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.

### Findings
1) The Best possible model for this particular dataset was Decision Trees. 
2) The metrics which I used were
  a) Confusion Matrix
   b) Accuracy score comparing predicted and Actual Values
### Main Errors
The Model was labeling people as true when they were indeed false
